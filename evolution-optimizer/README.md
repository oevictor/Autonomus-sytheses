# Evolution Optimizer

## Overview
The Evolution Optimizer is a Python-based optimization framework that implements various evolutionary algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms and Differential Evolution. It is designed to solve optimization problems by simulating the process of natural selection.

## Features
- Implements Genetic Algorithm and Differential Evolution algorithms.
- User-friendly interface for inputting optimization parameters.
- Modular design with separate components for optimizers, problems, and utilities.
- Sample optimization problem included for demonstration.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the application, execute the `main.py` file:

```
python src/main.py
```

Follow the prompts in the user interface to input your optimization parameters and select the desired algorithm.
